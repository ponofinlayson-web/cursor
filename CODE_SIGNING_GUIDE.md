# üîê Code Signing Guide for Public Distribution

## Overview

Code signing ensures your homepage package is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. This guide covers multiple approaches for signing your distribution package.

## üéØ **Signing Methods**

### **1. Self-Signed Certificate (Testing/Personal Use)**

#### **Quick Setup:**
```powershell
# Run the signing script
.\sign-package.ps1
```

#### **What it does:**
- Creates a self-signed certificate
- Signs your package with the certificate
- Adds signature verification to the package
- Creates a signed version of your ZIP file

#### **Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free and immediate
- ‚úÖ Good for testing
- ‚úÖ Works for personal distribution

#### **Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users will see "Unknown Publisher" warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not trusted by default in browsers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited for public distribution

### **2. Trusted Certificate Authority (Recommended for Public Use)**

#### **Popular CAs for Code Signing:**
- **DigiCert** - $99-399/year
- **Sectigo** - $99-299/year  
- **GlobalSign** - $199-399/year
- **Entrust** - $199-499/year

#### **Process:**
1. **Purchase** certificate from CA
2. **Generate** Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
3. **Submit** CSR to CA for validation
4. **Receive** signed certificate
5. **Install** certificate on your system

#### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Sign with purchased certificate
.\sign-package.ps1 -CertificatePath "C:\path\to\certificate.pfx" -CertificatePassword "your-password"
```

### **3. Open Source / Free Alternatives**

#### **Let's Encrypt (Limited)**
- Free SSL certificates
- Not ideal for code signing
- Better for web applications

#### **Self-Signed with Trust Store**
- Create self-signed certificate
- Distribute certificate to users
- Users install certificate in trusted store

## üõ† **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Package**
```bash
# Ensure your package is ready
ls -la custom-homepage-dark-blue-v1.0.zip
```

### **Step 2: Sign the Package**
```powershell
# Method 1: Self-signed (testing)
.\sign-package.ps1

# Method 2: With purchased certificate
.\sign-package.ps1 -CertificatePath "certificate.pfx" -CertificatePassword "password"
```

### **Step 3: Verify Signature**
```powershell
# Verify the signed package
.\verify-signature.ps1 -PackagePath "custom-homepage-dark-blue-v1.0-signed.zip"
```

### **Step 4: Distribute**
- Upload signed package to your distribution platform
- Provide verification instructions to users
- Include certificate if using self-signed

## üìã **Certificate Requirements**

### **For Code Signing:**
- **Type**: Code Signing Certificate
- **Key Size**: 2048-bit minimum (4096-bit recommended)
- **Validity**: 1-3 years typical
- **Storage**: Hardware token or software-based

### **For Web Distribution:**
- **Type**: SSL/TLS Certificate
- **Domain**: Your distribution domain
- **Wildcard**: Consider for subdomains

## üîç **Verification Process**

### **For Users:**
1. **Download** the signed package
2. **Run** verification script: `.\verify-signature.ps1`
3. **Check** signature details
4. **Verify** certificate authenticity

### **For Developers:**
1. **Test** on clean systems
2. **Verify** signature integrity
3. **Check** certificate validity
4. **Monitor** for tampering

## üöÄ **Distribution Platforms**

### **GitHub Releases:**
- Upload signed package
- Add verification instructions
- Use release notes for signature details

### **Personal Website:**
- Host signed package
- Provide verification script
- Include certificate download

### **Package Managers:**
- **Chocolatey**: Requires code signing
- **Homebrew**: May require signing
- **npm**: Uses package.json integrity

## üõ° **Security Best Practices**

### **Certificate Management:**
- **Secure Storage**: Use hardware tokens when possible
- **Access Control**: Limit who can sign packages
- **Rotation**: Renew certificates before expiration
- **Revocation**: Have revocation process ready

### **Package Integrity:**
- **Checksums**: Provide SHA-256 checksums
- **Multiple Signatures**: Consider multiple signing methods
- **Verification**: Always verify before distribution

## üìä **Cost Comparison**

| Method | Cost | Trust Level | Setup Time | Best For |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Self-Signed | Free | Low | Minutes | Testing/Personal |
| Trusted CA | $99-499/year | High | Days | Public Distribution |
| Open Source | Free | Medium | Hours | Community Projects |

## üéØ **Recommendations**

### **For Personal Use:**
- Use self-signed certificates
- Provide verification instructions
- Consider trusted CA for wider distribution

### **For Public Distribution:**
- Purchase certificate from trusted CA
- Use hardware token for security
- Implement proper verification process

### **For Open Source:**
- Use self-signed with community trust
- Provide clear verification instructions
- Consider GitHub's built-in signing

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
- **Certificate not found**: Install certificate in local store
- **Invalid signature**: Re-sign package with correct certificate
- **Expired certificate**: Renew or replace certificate
- **Permission denied**: Run as administrator

### **Verification Failures:**
- Check certificate installation
- Verify package integrity
- Ensure correct certificate path
- Check certificate validity period

## üìù **Next Steps**

1. **Choose** signing method based on your needs
2. **Run** the signing script
3. **Test** on clean systems
4. **Distribute** with verification instructions
5. **Monitor** for issues and feedback
